# Raft-Rats-App

This app is a white water rafting trip planner! I have always wanted to incorporate my love for coding into my love for rafting.
This app will let users (rafters) post new float trips, add themselves onto a list of attendees for existing trips and sign up for meals on these trips.

* Make the attending person "unique" so a user can only add themselves to the list once
* Make meals "unique" so that only one person could sign up for a specific time slot
* Add in a facebook oauth option
* Find a way to get the time to not show up on the date section in the show view since it is not relevant
* Style app for mobile screens
