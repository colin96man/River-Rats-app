# Raft-Rats-App

This app is a white water rafting trip planner! I have always wanted to incorporate my love for coding into my love for rafting.
This app will let users (or rafters) post new float trips, add themselves onto a list of attendees on existing trips and sign up for meals on existing float trips.
